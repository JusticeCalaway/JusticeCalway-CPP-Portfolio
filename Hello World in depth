# int= integer, a whole number, indicating our return type which is zero
# int main= start of your C++ program
# ()= indicates that main is a funtion, can be used for command line arguments

# std= standard library
# cout= character output
# ::= identifies a member of the namespace, std being the namespace and cout being the member
# << <<=  insertion operators
# end1= inserts a "Newline Character", like pressing "Enter" and performs a flush operation, flush operation makes sure the code is written to the output stream immediatly
